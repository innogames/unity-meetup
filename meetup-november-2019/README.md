1. **"Wake Up Your Game with Great Sound" by Ben Gallagher (Double Shot Audio)**

Preparing sound for your game is like preparing a cup of coffee. You need quality materials (SFX), the proper equipment for processing (game engine/middleware), and a well-tuned brewing technique to extract the best product (audio system/implementation). This caffeine-fueled talk will leave you with the tools necessary to brew a bottomless cup of auditory goodness that your players will love.

3. **"Bring Large Scale Traffic Simulation to Mobile with DOTS" by Hai Nam Pham (InnoGames)**

DOTS brings high performance and is the core of many new Unity upcoming features. Mastering DOTS is crucial, especially for large scale simulation. However, it also poses a steep learning curve for OOP programmers. In this talk, through the experience of developing a large-scale Traffic Simulation for mobile, I will share the lessons learned, the techniques and the pitfalls to avoid when using DOTS.
